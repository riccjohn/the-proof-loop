# The Proof Loop

**Understand → Prove → Decide**

## Overview

**The Proof Loop** is a framework to help us take a vague ask from a stakeholder to a clear build decision without building the wrong thing. Ideas go through three stages: **Understand** the problem, **Prove** the concept is thought through (**Proof of Thought**) and buildable (**Proof of Concept**), then **Decide** whether to build, extend, pivot, or shelve the idea.

The framework exists because when AI makes coding "cheap", it's too easy to offload the thinking as well, and three things tend to go wrong:

- We build before we truly understand the problem.
  - **Solution:** In the **Understand** stage, the stakeholder confirms a _What We Heard_ summary before anyone writes a plan.
- Agents make decisions for us, and then those decisions stay in a narrow context window and end up lost.
  - **Solution:** In the **Proof of Thought** stage, humans do the thinking (investigating the problem, possible solutions, and blockers) and log decisions in the **Experiment Card** so they outlive the session.
- A polished demo gets mistaken for deployable software.
  - **Solution:** In the **Proof of Concept** and **Decide** stages, we clearly label a demo a throwaway prototype or a tracer and state its limitations and tradeoffs up front.

Each stage needs to be earned, especially the final build. You'll treat your stakeholder as an investor who needs to explicitly fund the next stage of the process, and you earn that next stage through proving the experiment is still viable.

If you're familiar with [Hypothesis-Driven Development](https://www.thoughtworks.com/insights/articles/how-implement-hypothesis-driven-development), this may feel familiar. However, this approach adds explicit stakeholder confirmation of the problem up front and decision gates after each stage.

## The Loop At a Glance

In **Stage 1 (Understand)**, we start by ensuring everyone is on the same page by clearly restating the problem we're hearing that needs to be solved. Once confirmed, we document everything in our [**Experiment Card**](#experiment-card), which we'll continue to log decisions to as we move through the framework.

Next comes the **Proof of Thought** (2a): we begin investigating the problem and possible solutions further by gathering information and thinking through the options. What are the pros and cons? What other questions do we have? Do we see any blockers that would make this ask a moot point? What's your hypothesis? What do you think a solution would measurably achieve? Present this back to the stakeholder and log decisions in the **Experiment Card**.

If you're still moving forward (not all experiments do - they can always be pivoted or shelved at any point), you'll build out a **Proof of Concept** (2b) and test out the riskiest integrations. Demo the Proof of Concept back to your stakeholder. Update the **Experiment Card** and document decisions as Architectural Decision Records (ADRs) as you go.

The final decision: build it, extend it, pivot, or shelve it.

You'll run this loop for each experiment you have. Within the larger loop, you'll find that you can loop within a single stage (e.g. you may need to have a few conversations at Stage 1 to really understand the problem), and you can short-circuit the loop if you decide to pivot or shelve an idea before getting to the Proof of Concept stage. Many ideas will only make it to Stage 1 or 2a, and that's ok. You're weeding out ideas that aren't worth executing on and saving time. Each stage needs to be earned by the evidence / output of the previous stage.

![Cycle diagram of the Proof Loop. Understand leads through Gate 1 to Proof of Thought, then through Gate 2 to Proof of Concept, then through Gate 3 to Decide. Learnings from Decide feed the next idea, a pivot returns to Understand, and an idea can be shelved at any gate.](images/the-proof-loop-diagram.svg)

_The Proof Loop at a glance_

### Quick Start

1. **Listen first.** Meet with the stakeholder and ask about the problem, not the solution. No plans, estimates, or architecture yet. ([Stage 1](#1-understand))
2. **Send a [What We Heard](#what-we-heard) summary** and get a clear yes from the stakeholder. Repeat until you do.
3. **Start the [Experiment Card](#experiment-card).** Fill in who has the problem, a success signal, a kill signal, and what's out of scope. Pass [Gate 1](#gate-1-is-this-worth-exploring-further) with a named sponsor.
4. **Write the [Proof of Thought](#2a-proof-of-thought) yourself.** Lay out 2-3 approaches, find the hardest part, and write down the blockers. A human writes it, not an AI. Pass Gate 2.
5. **Build the smallest [Proof of Concept](#2b-proof-of-concept) that tests your riskiest assumption.** Label it a throwaway prototype or a tracer up front, and give a demo of what works and what doesnt. Pass Gate 3.
6. **[Decide](#3-decide):** build, extend (time-boxed), pivot, or shelve. Log it in the Experiment Card.

Every gate gets a dated entry in the Experiment Card, whatever the outcome. If a kill signal shows up at any step, stop. A cheap kill is a win.

## 1. Understand

**Timeframe:** Hours → days

**Purpose:** Turn a vague ask into a clear problem statement and ensure alignment

Stage 1 is a listening exercise. You first need to ensure the problem is being communicated clearly and that everyone involved understands it in the same way.

If you can't accurately and confidently explain the problem back to the stakeholder, you can't explain it to your team or an agent.

![Flow diagram of Stage 1. A raw ask is listened to, reflected back, and sent to the stakeholder to confirm. If they confirm, you agree on the problem and start the Experiment Card, then reach Gate 1 and move to Proof of Thought. If not, go back and ask more. With no sponsor or no appetite, the idea is shelved and the reason logged.](images/the-proof-loop-stage1.svg)

_Stage 1: from raw ask to an agreed problem_

### Listen

Ask about the problem, not the solution. Ask for info about what triggered this ask, examples of the problem surfacing itself, and whether anyone has attempted to solve this previously. Be an active listener.

If you're unsure about what's being asked or the problem presented, **expose your ignorance**. It's better to have everyone know there's a gap in communication than to say you understand and walk out of the meeting having no idea how to proceed.

See provided example questions below.

#### Questions

- **Trigger**
  - What happened that made you ask for this?
  - Why now?
  - Has this been attempted previously?
- **Users**
  - Who would use this?
  - Who communicates with them for feedback?
  - Who is our main stakeholder?
- **Outcome**
  - What does success look like? (success signal)
  - What findings or metrics would cause us to shelve the project or pivot? (kill signal)
  - If this works, who owns this project long-term?
  - What happens if we do nothing?

### Reflect Back

"Here's what I'm hearing, is that right?"

This will happen a few times throughout the initial meeting, as well as in a follow-up you should send after the meeting so you get a clear yes/no. The follow-up doc should be as succinct as possible. See the [**What We Heard**](#what-we-heard) template for an example.

This stage can loop on its own. You may need to run through it a few times before feeling certain everyone is on the same page.

### Agree on the Problem

Once the stakeholder confirms your understanding is correct, start the [**Experiment Card**](#experiment-card). There, you'll list out:

- who has the problem
- what it costs today / what the cost of doing nothing is
- what success looks like (the success signal)
- what result / finding would make us stop (the kill signal)
- what's out of scope

#### Gate 1: Is this worth exploring further?

- The stakeholder has clearly confirmed What We Heard
- A list of what is in and out of scope has been agreed on
- A named sponsor (the stakeholder who owns this long-term) is identified, and there's at least one success signal and one kill signal
- The Gate 1 outcome is logged in the **Experiment Card**

#### Outcomes

- **Go** to **2a. Proof of Thought,** **Pivot** (update the **Experiment Card** with a new hypothesis and why you're pivoting / what your learnings were), or **Shelve** (log a reason and what we learned in the **Experiment Card**)
- Docs created:
  - **What We Heard**, confirmed by the stakeholder
  - **Experiment Card,** with the Stage 1 sections filled in (problem, success signal, kill signal, out of scope)

## 2. Prove

**Prove** happens in two parts: a cheap **Proof of Thought** (2a), then a real **Proof of Concept** (2b).

### 2a. Proof of Thought

**Timeframe:** Days

**Purpose:** Before building anything substantial, show that we (the team, not agents) understand the problem well enough to think through it, name the hardest part, and design a way to test for it.

This is where the solution space begins and where you validate desirability and direction.

Start thinking through possible approaches. You'll discover new questions and potential blockers along the way. Write these down. Go talk to other teams if necessary to figure out if your potential approaches are viable. Find [the monkey](https://x.company/blog/posts/tackle-the-monkey-first/) (the hardest part of the problem) and investigate / think through the largest challenges. This may involve a quick, throwaway investigation (reading docs, hitting an API by hand), but you shouldn't be building anything yet.

Lay out 2-3 possible ways to solve the problems with the tradeoffs of each. Use a form that people can react to: a sketch, a diagram, even a bulleted list. If you have a meeting to go through these, you'll want something that people can look at, and ideally something you can update in front of everyone so you leave the meeting with an artifact everyone has agreed upon. Once it seems viable, add it to the **Experiment Card**.

The true output of this stage isn't a document or a demo, it's proof that the team (humans) have thought through the idea. The artifact you made (notes, sketch, diagram, etc) will likely be outdated the second you save it. That's ok.

**Human Only.** The only rule here is that the Proof of Thought document _must be created by a human_. Even if it's not read by anyone else directly, it's important that someone has thought through all of this. As you dive into the initial questions you had at the start, you'll find more questions that need answers that you didn't anticipate. You may not have found these if you had handed the original idea off to an AI agent.

Reviewing a document you had AI generate for you does not count. When you review an existing document, code, etc, the solution in front of you clouds your judgment and seems more solid than any potential alternatives you can think of. You'll be able to more fairly balance competing ideas as you encounter them than when you have a proposed solution given to you.

The journey is the destination here. A teacher gives their students a book report - not because they want to read the book reports, but because the act of writing one gives students a way to think through the data in front of them and show they processed it.

See [Proof of Thought by Erik Wiffin](https://erik.wiffin.com/posts/proof-of-thought/) for more context.

#### Gate 2: Is this worth a Proof of Concept?

- An approach has been chosen and its hypothesis has a clear pass/fail threshold
- The stakeholder has engaged with the approach, confirmed the thought process, and agrees no hard blockers are visible
- You have enough info to start a **Proof of Concept**, and the value justifies it
- The PoC scope is limited to the 1–2 integrations that could kill the idea if not figured out
- Everyone agrees on what the hardest part is
- Gate 2 outcome is logged in the **Experiment Card**

#### Outcomes

- **Go** to PoC, **Pivot** (update the **Experiment Card** with a new hypothesis and why you're pivoting / what your learnings were), or **Shelve** (log a reason and what we learned in the **Experiment Card**)
- Docs created:
  - Proof of Thought notes: human-written ONLY, any format (notes, sketch, diagram) - they don't need to be polished
  - **Experiment Card**, updated with the chosen approach, hypothesis, and riskiest assumptions laid out
  - Technical ADRs for any significant technical choices made so far (if any)

### 2b. Proof of Concept

**Timeframe:** Days → weeks

**Purpose:** Produce evidence that the solution is viable (or not). This is the stage where high-level stakeholders have something concrete to look at, use, and discuss tradeoffs.

**Activities:**

- [Tackle the Monkey First](https://x.company/blog/posts/tackle-the-monkey-first/) - test the riskiest parts and see if your hypothesis holds.
- **Decide prototype vs. [tracer](https://www.aihero.dev/tracer-bullets).** Decide up front whether the code is _throwaway_ (this is ok, but make this a clear part of the plan) or _keepable_. AI tools make it easy to blur the two.
  - **Tracer:** If you want to keep it, it's probably best to use a tracer - a slim, e2e feature (usually the one you have the most questions or concerns about. Pick the "monkey" feature that if you couldn't solve, would kill the project.)
  - **Prototype:**
    - Throwaway code that's built to learn, not to keep
    - **Try to get real users (2-5):** measure whether they _act on_ the output, not just whether they like it
    - Behavior beats opinion. Compliments and generic statements are _not_ evidence. Do people actually use it? Does it solve their problems?
- **Team autonomy** - Within the time budget, scope, and problem-space, teams can change stories, specs, tools, and approach without needing permission (DORA team experimentation). The hypothesis and problem stay fixed, but everything else can move. Developers should talk to potential users directly.

#### Gate 3: Demo

- Demo the Proof of Concept for the stakeholder
- Show the good and bad parts. Be honest with what it's capable of, where it falls short, where things could be improved given more time, and where there are still questions or parts you're unsure could be overcome.
- We've proved the toughest parts can or cannot be built
- Stakeholder agrees with our findings
- Gate 3 outcome is logged in the **Experiment Card**

#### Outcomes

- Move to **Decide** with the evidence you've created
- Docs created:
  - The Proof of Concept itself, with the pros/cons, labeled honestly as a throwaway prototype or a tracer
  - Findings from the demo: what worked, what didn't, what's still unknown, results against success and kill signals
  - Technical ADRs for significant choices made while building the PoC.

## 3. Decide

**Timeframe:** Days

**Purpose:** Make a final call. Given what you've learned so far, does everyone think it should be built, extended, pivoted, or shelved?

#### Outcomes

- Build - the experiment proved the hypothesis and you can move on to a larger build
- Extend - buy more time for another short, clear stage. Make sure this is time-boxed
- Pivot - revisit the hypothesis completely - did you solve the wrong problem? Did you find out the problem wasn't as bad as initially thought? Could an off-the-shelf solution solve it more cheaply?
- Shelve - the hypothesis didn't hold, or the costs are too high, or the appetite just isn't there at the moment. Document your learnings and this experiment gets put on the shelf. If things change, you'll want everything documented so you can pick it back up.
- Docs created:
  - A final entry in the **Experiment Card**'s decision log. Did your hypothesis hold? What did the team + stakeholder decide?

The loop ends when the project is shelved or gets the green light for a larger build. Extend and Pivot send you back through a stage.

The prior stages are all in what Kent Beck describes as an "**Explore**" phase. The **Decide** stage is where things _can_ move to the "**Expand**" phase, where production work is started. It's still cheap to kill projects in the Explore phase, but a larger investment is required to move to **Expand**. Expand requires removing bottlenecks, hardening systems, scaling, and more ownership.

## Practical Notes

1. **Understand before you plan.** No plans, estimates, or architecture until the stakeholder confirms "Yes, that's what I'm asking for."
2. **Treat the stakeholder as an investor.** You need to get funding from them to pay for the next stage. Hours and tokens still have a cost, and so does building the wrong thing.
3. **Get problem-shaped asks.** "Build us an agent that does X" is a vague ask. We need to translate that into a problem statement and only then can we start to investigate what the solution is.
4. **Define your kill signal and success signal up front** to reduce bias. This defines whether you "pivot or persevere" as [Hypothesis-Driven Development](https://www.alexandercowan.com/hypothesis-driven-development-practitioners-guide/) puts it. Don't let sunk cost and demo excitement push you to persevere when you should pivot.
5. **A cheap kill is a win.** Every idea you stop early is time, money, and tokens you didn't spend on the wrong build.
6. **Always leave a record.** Every gate gets a dated entry in the Experiment Card's decision log, no matter the outcome. "Failed" experiments and dead ideas still teach us something.
7. **Every stage is time-boxed.**
    1. You choose the timing within the given range (i.e. Stage 1 is hours-days, Stage 2a is days, etc.)
    2. You can extend, but more time must be earned
8. **Building with AI Tools is fine/encouraged**, but:
    1. a human must be able to explain every gate artifact and the code paths _that matter_ without notes (the same bar as the Proof of Thought)
    2. the success signal is written from real scenarios _before_ any code is written, not by an agent based on the solution
    3. the PoC is labeled honestly as a throwaway or a tracer
9. **WIP limits.** AI tooling encourages teams to build many PoCs at once. Limit this. Stop starting, start finishing (making decisions)

## Tools & Templates

Docs, especially technical ADRs, should live in source control co-located with the code itself. Experiment docs can also live in the repo, but keep them separate from technical ADRs. Here's an example structure:

```text
docs/
├── EXPERIMENT.md     # problem, signals, approach, hypothesis, decision log
├── notes/            # What We Heard, proof of thought, findings: any format
└── adr/              # technical ADRs, only when needed
```

Store the Experiment Card wherever your team already looks for work: an existing team repo, a wiki space, or the ticket that started the ask. Link it from that original ask, so anyone who revisits the idea can find the record even if the experiment never reaches a build stage. If the experiment does reach a build stage, move the docs into the codebase.

### What We Heard

This can be an email or a message. If you keep it in the repo, put it in `docs/notes/`.

### Experiment Card

The hypothesis follows Barry O'Reilly's [hypothesis-driven development](https://www.thoughtworks.com/insights/articles/how-implement-hypothesis-driven-development) format from Thoughtworks, and the overall card is adapted from the Test Card in _Testing Business Ideas_ (David Bland & Alex Osterwalder, creator of the Business Model Canvas). The decision log's prompts are loosely based on the Learning Card from the same book. The kill signal's "what result, by what date" follows Annie Duke's kill criteria in _Quit_.
